- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Docker (if using Docker for development)

## Dependencies

- Express
- Nunjucks
- GOV.UK Frontend
- Sass
- EJS
- CORS

## Dev Dependencies

- Nodemon
- Concurrently

## GOV.UK Design System and Nunjucks Setup

### GOV.UK Design System (GDS)

The application makes use of the GOV.UK Design System for its user interface components. This design system provides a range of accessible, mobile-friendly, and user-friendly components that are in line with government design guidelines.

### Nunjucks

Nunjucks serves as the templating engine for this application, facilitating the server-side rendering of dynamic content. The engine offers robust features such as template inheritance, macros, and asynchronous control.

### Configuration

Nunjucks is configured within `app.js` as follows:

```javascript
import nunjucks from 'nunjucks';

nunjucks.configure([
    "node_modules/govuk-frontend/",
    "views"
], {
    autoescape: true,
    express: app
});

app.set('view engine', 'njk');
```

### Usage

To utilise a GOV.UK Frontend component within a Nunjucks template, simply include it as shown below:

```njk
{% from "govuk/components/button/macro.njk" import govukButton %}

{{ govukButton({
  text: "Continue"
}) }}
```

## Installation

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd app_frontend
    ```
3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose-local.yml` file is configured to allow the application to run in two modes:

1. **Standalone**: In this mode, the application without requiring a backend service.
2. **With API Backend**: In this mode, the application connects to a separate API backend service for dynamic data.

### Standalone Static Page

If you intend to run the application as a standalone application, you can simply remove or comment out the `external_links` section in the `docker-compose-local.yml` file:

```yml
# external_links:
#   - api_backend 
```

### With API Backend

If you wish to connect the application to a separate API backend running in another Docker container, you'll need to specify the backend service in the `external_links` section:

```yml
external_links:
  - api_backend # Change this to your backend if it's called something different
```

Replace `api_backend` with the name of your backend container if it's different.

To run the application in either mode, navigate to the `docker_local` directory and execute:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

### Development

To run the application in development mode, execute the following command:

1. **Navigate to the `docker_local` directory**
    ```bash
    cd docker_local
    ```
2. **Run the local build script**
    ```bash
    ./local_build.sh
    ```

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

### Viewing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
## BrowserSync

BrowserSync is a powerful tool that helps save time by automatically reloading your browser or even multiple browsers at the same time whenever file changes are detected.

### Running BrowserSync

To run BrowserSync alongside your development server, you can use the following npm script:

```bash
npm run start:browserSync
```

This script is configured to watch for changes in `.njk` files in the `/views` directory, as well as `.js` and `.css` files in the `/public` directory. When changes are detected, BrowserSync will automatically reload the browser.

### When Not to Use BrowserSync

While BrowserSync is incredibly useful for front-end development, there are scenarios where it may not be appropriate:

1. **Production Environment**: Never use BrowserSync in a production environment. It is a development tool and not meant for production use.

2. **Heavy Backend Logic**: If you're working primarily on server-side logic and not on the front-end, running BrowserSync might be unnecessary.

3. **Limited Resources**: BrowserSync can be resource-intensive. If you're running on a machine with limited resources, you might want to skip it.

## Nunjucks Templating

Nunjucks templating is configured in this project. For styles, layout, and components, consult the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk).

### Examples

1. **Rendering a Text Input**

    ```njk
    {% from "govuk/components/input/macro.njk" import govukInput %}
    {{ govukInput({
      label: {
        text: "Full name"
      },


      id: "full-name",
      name: "fullName"
    }) }}
    ```

2. **Rendering a Button**

    ```njk
    {% from "govuk/components/button/macro.njk" import govukButton %}
    {{ govukButton({
      text: "Continue"
    }) }}
    ```

## Understanding `package.json`

The `package.json` file holds metadata about the project and lists its dependencies. Below is a breakdown of the scripts:

- `start:dev`: Initiates the development server using Nodemon.
- `sass`: Compiles the Sass files into CSS.
- `sass:watch`: Monitors the Sass files for changes and compiles them into CSS.
- `dev`: Runs both the development server and the Sass compiler in watch mode using Concurrently.

To run the development server and Sass compiler concurrently, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Debugging with IntelliJ IDEA

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure the Docker plugin is installed in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Your Node.js application should be configured to run in debug mode. This can be done by adding a `--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229` flag to your Node.js start script, allowing the debugger to attach to the Node.js process.

### Steps

#### 1. Edit Docker Compose File

Add the debug port to your `docker-compose-local.yml` under the `frontend` service:

```yml
services:
  frontend:
    ...
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "9229:9229"  # Debug port
```

#### 2. Edit `package.json`

Modify your `start:dev` script to enable debugging. For example:

```json
"start:dev": "nodemon --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 app.js",
```

#### 3. Rebuild and Restart Docker Containers

Run the following commands to apply the changes:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

#### 4. IntelliJ IDEA Configuration

- Navigate to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
- Click on the `+` button to add a new configuration.
- Choose `Node.js`.
- In the `Node.js` configuration, set the following:
    - **Host**: `localhost`
    - **Port**: `9229`
- Save the configuration.

#### 5. Attach Debugger

With the configuration saved, you should now see your new debug configuration in the top-right corner of IntelliJ IDEA. Click the Debug icon (a bug symbol) to start debugging.

#### 6. Set Breakpoints

You can now set breakpoints in your code within IntelliJ IDEA.

#### 7. Debug

Trigger the code path that you want to debug. IntelliJ should hit the breakpoints you've set.

This will allow you to debug your Node.js application running in a Docker container using IntelliJ IDEA.

Certainly! Here's how to set up debugging for your Node.js application running in a Docker container using Visual Studio Code. This guide is in Markdown format for easy inclusion in your README file.

## Debugging with Visual Studio Code

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have the Docker extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
2. Your Node.js application should be configured to run in debug mode. This can be done by adding a `--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229` flag to your Node.js start script, allowing the debugger to attach to the Node.js process.

### Steps

#### 1. Edit Docker Compose File

Add the debug port to your `docker-compose-local.yml` under the `frontend` service:

```yml
services:
  frontend:
    ...
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "9229:9229"  # Debug port
```

#### 2. Edit `package.json`

Modify your `start:dev` script to enable debugging. For example:

```json
"start:dev": "nodemon --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 app.js",
```

#### 3. Rebuild and Restart Docker Containers

Run the following commands to apply the changes:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

#### 4. VS Code Configuration

Create a new file in your project root called `.vscode/launch.json` if it doesn't already exist, and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Docker: Attach to Node",
      "port": 9229,
      "address": "localhost",
      "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app",
      "protocol": "inspector"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 5. Attach Debugger

With the configuration saved, you should now see your new debug configuration in the Debug view in VS Code. Click the green "Start Debugging" button or press `F5` to start debugging.

#### 6. Set Breakpoints

You can now set breakpoints in your code within VS Code.

#### 7. Debug

Trigger the code path that you want to debug. VS Code should hit the breakpoints you've set.

This will allow you to debug your Node.js application running in a Docker container using Visual Studio Code.
